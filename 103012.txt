Input subject ID according to 4 digit convention
Request overwrite if run numbers overlap

/stim:
stim.xlsx
	- Removed “Lexical Decision Stimuli” from headers -- Notify input demands**
	- Removed headers:
		- English (1), Spanish (2), Homographs (3) -- Notify**
	- Renamed to stim.xlsx -- Notify input demands**

ToAsk:
	- 201 in “presentation order”, but 101 in spanish, 101 in english, and 104 in homographs.
- Ignore presentation order, but follow “homograph after spanish” convention?  This will produce 303 trials.  However, 90-100 was originally requested.
- Also, need more spanish than homograph in order to follow rule.
- Upon response, you want the word to disappear (if before 1s is reached), but it still must wait until the ITI is finished.  So, the participant will not know whether they pressed or not if after 1s.  Is this okay?
- Just to clarify, the ITI total time takes the 1s into account (if participant did not respond early)?
- What buttons to press for S/E?
